# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics, which I solved as I got through program.

## Table Of Contents

### Tutorials

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-neural-networks): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/sentiment-analysis-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-to-pytorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks): Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.
* [Weight Initialization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/weight-initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.
* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/style-transfer): Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!

### Final Project
In this project, we had to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We had to use dataset of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

### Requirements
  - `opencv`
  - `jupyter`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `pillow`
  - `scipy`
